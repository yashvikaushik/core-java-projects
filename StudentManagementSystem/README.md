# 📚 Student Management System

A simple **Java-based console application** that allows you to manage student records efficiently using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **file handling**. This project is designed as a beginner-friendly way to practice core Java concepts while building something practical.

## ✅ Features

- ➕ Add a new student  
- 🔍 Search for a student by ID  
- ❌ Delete a student  
- 📋 View all students  
- 💾 Persistent storage using file handling (data stored in `students.txt`)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- File Handling (`FileWriter`, `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `PrintWriter`)  
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code *(your choice)*  
- Text File as local database (no external DB used)

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Run the application using your Java IDE or terminal.
2. Select from the console menu to perform operations:
=== Student Management Menu ===
	1.	Add Student
	2.	Search Student by ID
	3.	Delete Student
	4.	View All Students
	5.	Exit
3. Student data is stored in `students.txt` and persists after the program ends.

🧠 What I Learned
	•	Implementing real-world OOP principles
	•	Working with file I/O in Java
	•	Using Scanner, File, BufferedReader, PrintWriter effectively
	•	Structuring a Java project with multiple classes
	•	Error handling and data persistence

 🌟 Future Improvements
	•	🖼️ GUI version using Java Swing
	•	🗃️ Database integration with MySQL and JDBC
	•	✏️ Edit/update student info
	•	📊 Sort and filter student records
	•	🔍 Advanced search (by name or course)
